        "\n",
        "The analysis for the project was excellent, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading the entire project. There were several aspects that stood out to me:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The project demonstrated a solid understanding of the hyperparameters used in the decision tree model.\n",
        "* The data was correctly split and a sanity check was performed on the shape, ensuring the data was handled appropriately.\n",
        "* The quality check of the data was thorough and well-executed, resulting in clean and reliable data.\n",
        "* The code itself was clean and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed in order to conclude the project. These issues are marked in the code with a \"Danger\" tag, and I would recommend focusing on resolving them:\n",
        "\n",
        "* It seems that the data split may be unbalanced, which could affect the model's performance. Please refer to [Warning 1](#warning1) and [Warning 0](#warning0) in the code for more details.\n",
        "* There was not a sufficient iteration of parameters for the model. It is recommended to try at least three different parameter combinations to find the optimal configuration. Please refer to [Danger 1](#danger1) in the code for more information.\n",
        "* The accuracy of the train set and other important sanity checks were not displayed. It would be beneficial to include these metrics for a comprehensive evaluation. Please see [Warning 2](#warning2) in the code for further guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* A proper sanity check of the model, such as comparing it with baselines or using a confusion matrix, was not performed. This step is crucial in assessing the model's performance. Please refer to [Warning 3](#warning3) in the code for suggestions on how to address this.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, with these fixes, the project will be fantastic and well-rounded. I appreciate the ordered code, excellent explanations, and your proficiency in Python. Don't forget to implement the necessary fixes and update the conclusions accordingly.\n",
